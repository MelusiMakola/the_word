Title: Word Guessing Game

Description:

The Word Guessing Game is a Python program designed to entertain users by challenging them to guess a randomly selected word within a limited number of attempts. The game presents a blank space representation of the word to the player, with each blank representing a letter. The player then guesses letters one at a time. If the guessed letter is present in the word, all occurrences of that letter are revealed in the word. Otherwise, the player loses a life. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the entire word or runs out of lives.

Features:
- Randomly selects words from a predefined list.
- Displays a blank representation of the word to the player.
- Allows the player to guess letters one at a time.
- Tracks the number of lives remaining for the player.
- Provides feedback on whether the guessed letter is present in the word.
- Ends the game when the player correctly guesses the word or runs out of lives.
- Offers the option to play again after the game ends.
